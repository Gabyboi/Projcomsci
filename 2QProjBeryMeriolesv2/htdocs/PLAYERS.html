 	<h2> Nba Legends </h2>
 	</div>
	<p>Basketball has been around for about 130 years, and it has come a long way. It started out as an indoor activity during winter and<br>then to being played professionally. It only had 13 simple rules from then more rules and regulations were added as the game was evolving.<br> Players like Elgin Baylor, Drazen Petrovic, Marques Haynes, Reece Tatum, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Larry Bird and many<br> more had much impact that it changed how games were played from soaring high above the rim, shooting jumpshots with grace, hitting dagger 3's, and making the corwd go wild with flashy moves.<br> 
	<br>	
	I read through some of Sports Websites ranked NBA Players both retired and currently playing who've had a strong impact on the game and here are my top 5 legends:<br>
	<br>
	5. Julius Erving <br>
		<br>
		Julius Erving or Dr. J was a man ahead of his time, everytime he'd make spectacular dunks you could hear the roaring of excitement <br>of the fans. He was able to do everything on the court and even fill arena seats everywhere, Julius made basketball more fun and <br>exciting to watch. He played 5 seasons for the American Basketball Assosciation and the NBA. he won a championship with the <br>Philadelphia 76ers with Moses Malone. <br>
		<br>
	4.	Wilt Chamberlain<br>
		<br>
		Wilt Chamberlain was the most unstoppable offensive force the game of basketball has ever seen. His size and strength were <br>unparalleled, and he complemented them with remarkable skill and a feel for the game that went unappreciated by most casual fans.<br>
		<br>
		"The Big Dipper" scored 100 points in one game and grabbed 55 rebounds in another. He averaged 50.4 points for the 1961-62 season.<br>

		Chamberlain was so dominant, the NBA felt compelled to make the following rule changes in order to level the playing field: <br>
		<br>
		1. The lane was widened from 12 to 16 feet.<br>
		<br>
		2. Offensive goaltending was introduced.<br>
		<br>
		3. Throwing an inbounds pass over the backboard was prohibited.<br>
		<br>
		4. A new rule stated that free-throw shooters could not cross the free-throw line until the ball hit the rim, in response to <br>Chamberlain experimenting with dunking his free throws.<br>
		<br>

	3. Lebron James<br>
		LeBron James is the Tiger Woods of basketball. He could probably sell water to a well. At such a tender age, he's drawing <br>comparisons to former NBA greats like Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and his idol, Michael Jordan. LeBron even carried his team to<br> the NBA Finals in 2006-2007, only to be swept by the Spurs.(BleacherReport,2008)<br>
		<br>
		While his team isn't quite as talented as the other elite rosters in the league, just having LeBron means the sky is the limit for<br> the Cavaliers. If his plan to ditch Cleveland and head to Brooklyn when the Nets move to the Big Apple materializes, the King<br> will become the most marketable athlete in sports, not just the NBA.(Bleacher Report,2008)<br>
		<br>
	2. Larry Bird and Earvin "Magic" Johnson<br>
		<br>
		I had a very difficult time deciding about my top 2 and I came to Magic and Bird. These two uniquely skilled players played at a<br>time where games were the league reached an all time low that it made NBA Finals aired on tape delay. The two were Franchise<br>players, Magic played for the Los Angeles Lakers while Bird played for the Celtics. The rivalry between the two revived the<br> reputation of the NBA and playing at a whole new level.<br> 
		<br>
		Magic Johnson led his team to winning 5 championships. His style of play was fascinating, they ran a play called "Showtime" offense<br> with him rebounding the ball and starting a break. He would do some flashy passes that looked so unreal.<br> 
		<br>

		Larry Bird was one of the most skilled players in the NBA giving his best both offensively and defensively. He is known as an<br> extremely confident shooter that he won the 1988 3-Point Contest while wearing his warm-up jacket and consistently talking trash to<br> his opponents like Shawn Kemp, where he dropped 40 points against the Seattle Sonics the first time they met!<br>
		<br>
	1. Michael Jordan<br>
		<br>	
		The person whom I consider the greatest of all time! Mj was known all over the world and even people who didn't watch or play<br> basketball knew him. Winning 6 rings and no losses in the finals. He had an elegant and magnificent jumpshot and fadeaway. He<br> transformed the style of basketbal with his air-defying dunks and his clutch shooting. Basketball has now intense popularity if not<br> for MJ.<br> 
		<br>
		People would always say they wanted to "Be like Mike". Kids wagging their tongues, players 	post-up leaning on their defenders<br> before deciding to make their move. He his own signature brand, Jordan, signed with Nike. His very first shoe released Jordan I's<br> are not only worn as game shoes as sneakers off the court and treated as a luxury. He even has his own movie and documentaries<br> like Space Jam and the Final Dance.<br>
